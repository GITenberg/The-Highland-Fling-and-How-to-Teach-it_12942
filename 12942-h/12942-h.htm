<h2>THE HIGHLAND FLING</h2>
<h2>AND HOW TO TEACH IT.</h2>
<br>

<p>In teaching fancy dances, more rapid progress will be made by forming
exercises characteristic of the movements to be executed.</p>

<p>This dance comprises a hopping movement and the laws of opposition must
be observed with the hands and arms, therefore I will give a few
exercises which must be thoroughly practised.</p>

<p>In describing, the letter R denotes right foot, L, the left.</p>
<br>

<h3>EXERCISE NO. I</h3>

<p>Hop four times on L. (one bar, four counts.)</p>

<p>Hop four times on R. (one bar, four counts.)</p>

<p>Hop four times on L. (one bar, four counts.)</p>

<p>Hop four times on R, turning completely around towards the right hand.
(one bar, four counts.)</p>

<p>Repeat the whole movement by hopping first on R, then on L, then on R,
then on L, turning towards the left hand.</p>

<p>This exercise lays the foundation for the fling.</p>
<br>

<h3>Exercise No. 2.</h3>

<p>Stand on L, extend R to second position, (count one.)</p>

<p>Bring the R up back of L, (count two.)</p>

<p>Extend R to second position, (count three.)</p>

<p>Bring R up in front of L, (count four, one bar.)</p>

<p>Go through the same positions with L, to the same number of counts, (one
bar.)</p>

<p>Repeat again with R, (count four, one bar.)</p>

<p>Hop four times on R, turning towards the right hand, (count four, one
bar.)</p>

<p>This makes four bars.</p>

<p>Repeat the entire movements with L, which will bring the turn the last
time on L, towards the left hand, completing the eight bars.</p>

<p>Note&mdash;In placing the R or L in second position, do not extend it too far
out, let the toe only touch the floor, the heel well raised. The toe
should be pointed towards the floor as much as possible in all
movements.</p>
<br>

<h3>Exercise No. 3.</h3>

<p>This exercise I introduce for the changing of weight from one foot to
the other.</p>

<p>Hop on L, and at the same time and count, extend R to second position,
(count one.)</p>

<p>Hop again on L, and at the same time and count, bring R up in front of
L, (count two, R is now up.)</p>

<p>Hop on to R and at the same time, and count, extend L to second position
(count one.)</p>

<p>Hop again on R, and bring L up in front, toe pointed, (count two.)
Repeat changing from one foot to the other, until an easy movement has
been acquired.</p>
<br>

<h3>Exercise No. 4.</h3>

<p>Hand Movements&mdash;Place right hand on the hip, the fingers towards the
back, raise the left well up with the fingers towards the head which
makes a rounding position of the arm, or describing a half circle from
the shoulder to the fingers, the head should be inclined a little to the
left.</p>

<p>Hold this position, (count four, one bar.)</p>

<p>Reverse it, right up, left on hip, (count four, one bar.)</p>

<p>Repeat the left, (count four, one bar.)</p>

<p>Reverse it, right up, left on hip, (count four, one bar.) while the turn
is being made.</p>

<p>Keep this position, right up, left on hip, (count four, one bar.)</p>

<p>Note&mdash;The movements of the feet will be changed from R to L.</p>

<p>Reverse it, left up, right on hip, (count four, one bar.)</p>

<p>Repeat, right up, left on hip, (count four, one bar.)</p>

<p>Reverse it, left up, right on hip, (count four, one bar.) 8 bars will
complete the hand movements, leaving them in position for the next step.</p>

<p>As the effect of the dance depends largely upon the artistic movements
of the hands, this exercise should be well studied.</p>

<p>Abbreviation Left hand up, while the R foot is moving and the L hopping.</p>

<p>Right hand up while the L foot is moving and the R hopping.</p>

<p>Left hand up, while the R foot is moving and the L hopping.</p>

<p>Right hand up, while turning with hopping step on R foot.</p>

<p>Keep the right hand up after turning for the beginning of the next step.</p>

to R, (which is up in front.) extending L toe to second position, heel
raised, (count one.)</p>

<p>NOTE&mdash;The change of hand positions, hopping on to R, extending L to
second position, must be done to one count.</p>

<p>Note&mdash;A complete turn should be made during the four counts given,
turning one fourth on each hop of the R foot.</p>

<p>Turn towards the right hand when turning on the right foot.</p>

<h5>NOTICE.</h5>

<p>As I have a little space here owing to a slight error. I will call
attention to the music for the Highland Fling. Properly accented music
for the dance is of the utmost importance, and I am prepared to furnish
the same in manuscript to my patrons for one dollar orchestra parts.
There is no printed copy of the music I use to my knowledge. Will
furnish first violin part for twenty-five cents.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
